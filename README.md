# ARIF
Acute Respiratory Infections Forecast - 
an IronHAck student project

# Project description
Acute respiratory infection is a serious infection that prevents normal breathing function. It usually begins as a viral infection in the nose, trachea (windpipe), or lungs. If the infection is not treated, it can spread to the entire respiratory system. Acute respiratory infection prevents the body from getting oxygen and can result in death.

Acute respiratory infections are infectious, which means they can spread from one person to another. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), acute respiratory infections kill an estimated 2.6 million children annually every year worldwide. According to Sant√© publique France : 40,000 deaths in Europe per year and nearly 8 months of life expectancy lost due to exposure to fine particles

ARIs are caused by various respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses such as RSV, rhinovirus, or metapneumovirus. The purpose of ARI surveillance is to monitor epidemics caused by these viruses.
The Main goal of this project is to create a tool able to  predict forecast of ARI incidence using weather forecast and pollution data.
Alternate goal: Perform an analysis of correlation between ARIs, weather and pollution.
